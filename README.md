# Steps to run the project


# To create the indices of the documents, we can run the
## data_parser.py
which reads the wikipedia dataset and creates indices of various sizes.


# To run the search you can run the 
## file data_query.py
At the moment it uses a hardcoded phrase to query the system. This is easily extendable to take user input.





# To run analysis we can run the
## analysis.py
It will run and create plots against different types of analysis techniques.
